1. Starting services:
    - regular build
    docker-compose up

    - build services with reference to the docker-compose.yaml file
    docker-compose up -d

    - build services with reference to the docker-compose.yaml file and Dockerfile
    docker compose up -d --build

2. Stopping all running containers:
    docker-compose stop

3. removes services:
    - normal removal for containers
    docker-compose down
    - for deleting containers and its cached memory (**USE WITH PRECAUTION**. THERE ARE NO CONFIRMATIONS)
    docker compose down -v

4. Viewing logs:
    - simplified log
    docker-compose logs
    - this shows the logs of the services. To follow logs in real-time:
    docker-compose logs -f
    - viewing the status of services:
    docker-compose ps

5. Executing a command inside a container:
    docker-compose exec <service_name> <command>
    docker-compose exec airflow-scheduler airflow

6. Others
    - build images (pre-built services taken from the official website):
    docker-compose build

    -scaling services:
    docker-compose up --scale <service_name>=<number_of_instances>
    docker-compose up --scale web=3
